tile at position (i,j) can be accessed with: Board.graph.nodes[("tile", (i,j))]
    which returns a dictionary with the tile's attributes.  Note that points and
    tiles are indexed in the same way as PyCatan library indexed them.
tile attributes: 
    position: Coordinate
    tile_type: Tile.TileType
    number: int
    thief: boolean
    
point at position (i,j) can be accessed with: Board.graph.nodes[("point", (i,j))]
    which returns a dictionary with the point's attributes.  Note that points and
    tiles are indexed in the same way as PyCatan library indexed them.
point attributes:
    position: Coordinate
    owner: int
    building: Building.BuildingTypes

edge connecting points (i,j) and (k,l) can be accessed with: 
    Board.graph[("point", (i,j))][("point", (k,l))]
    which returns a dictionary with the edge's attributes.
edge attributes:
    owner: int
    
edge connecting point (i,j) and tile (k,l) can be accessed with:
    Board.graph[("point", (i,j))][("tile", (k,l))]
    currently these edges have no attributes
    
Graph is undirected, of course.  Every tile is connected to all 6 points around it
    and each point is connected to the 3 points around it and the 3 tiles surrounding 
    it.  Points, tiles, and edges on the ocean are still considered regular points, 
    tiles, and edges.
